# Theory Maker - sketch out your Theory of Change

[Theory Maker](http://quicktoc.info) is a free web app for making any kind of causal diagram, i.e. a diagram which uses arrows to say what contributes to what. 
You make the diagrams just by typing the names of the elements (called `variables`) in a structured way into a (resizeable) window, and you get a live diagram as output which reflects what you type. 

In particular, it is optimised for making [theories of change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_change), [logframes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_framework_approach), etc. - special kinds of pragmatic causal theory which are particularly popular at the moment in the world of [monitoring and evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monitoring_and_evaluation) (M&E).

Theory Maker is most often used by M&E staff for quickly sketching out project theories and evaluation plans. But scientists, especially social scientists, and policy makers use it too.

Theory Maker is **experimental**, open-source, incomplete and in rapid development. Please don't rely on it for your urgent project proposal. But as you can immediately download any diagrams you make, you don't have much to lose, so go ahead and try it out. However, the rules which turn the text into diagrams may yet change from time to time, so a text which works now might produce a slightly different diagram in a month's time. 

Please [tweet me](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@stevepowell99 #theorymaker) me your comments, problems and suggestions. 

Plus, Theory Maker is based on a *theory* of Theories of Change. So when you diagram your theory using Theory Maker, the examples help you to make a *real theory*, expressed using variables and rules to link them up, not just a nice picture.
I have just started to set out some of this theory in the examples provided here. There is a *lot* more to come. 

## What Theory Maker provides

### Quick and easy ...

Theory Maker tries to make it easy to make a diagram using only text typed according to simple rules. It is most useful for quick prototyping, discussions and presentations, not for all the details of project plans. 

### ... theories of change

There are plenty of toolkits for making various kinds of network graphs and UML diagrams. Some are offline, some are online, for example [plantuml](http://plantuml.com/). But Theory Maker is optimised for, as the name says, theories of change, logframes, etc.

### ... with boxes

One special Theory Maker feature is that you can also create boxes to group the variables of your diagram, for example to mark off different phases, regions or stakeholders. You can also nest the boxes inside one another, like Russian dolls. And you can show and hide the boxes with a click. This is particularly useful in the field of project monitoring and evaluation, in which we often want to group variables together to show non-causal groupings e.g. project phase, geographical distribution etc. Many project templates like the Logical Framework Approach don't have a standard way to group variables, which often tempts users to use arrows to link them instead, implying a causal link where there isn't one.
