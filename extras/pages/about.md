# Theory Maker - sketch out your Theory of Change

[Theory Maker](http://quicktoc.info) is a free web app by [Steve Powell](http://stevepowell.blot.im) for making any kind of causal diagram, i.e. a diagram which uses arrows to say what contributes to what. 
You make the diagrams just by typing the names of the elements (called `variables`) in a structured way into a (resizeable) window, and you get a live diagram as output which reflects what you type. 

In particular, it is optimised for making [theories of change](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_change), [logframes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_framework_approach), etc. - special kinds of pragmatic causal theory which are particularly popular at the moment in the world of [monitoring and evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monitoring_and_evaluation) (M&E).

Theory Maker is most often used by M&E staff for quickly sketching out project theories and evaluation plans. But scientists, especially social scientists, and policy makers use it too.

# About Theory Maker

Theory Maker is a free, open-source project. The license is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j79tk9ulwrzs47g/license.txt?dl=0). The engine which creates the diagrams (using Graphviz) is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/sxoeir14lk5udx6/t2a.r?dl=0) and for the web interface (using Shiny) is [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/730r3i749frg37t/app.R?dl=0) if you want it. It is under rapid development and run on a shoestring so please don't rely on it being there next week. I plan to keep it running for years, but who knows. 

**I also restart the server every day or so** as I update the code, so make sure you save a copy of your text or save your diagram as a permanent link, so you don't lose your work.

I don't plan ever to charge for Theory Maker or to make money from it directly. It is a project for airing some ideas I have about Theories of Change to accompany a book I am writing.


Plus, Theory Maker is based on a *theory* of Theories of Change. So when you diagram your theory using Theory Maker, the examples help you to make a *real theory*, expressed using variables and rules to link them up, not just a nice picture.
I have just started to set out some of this theory in the examples provided here. There is a *lot* more to come.
